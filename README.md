# TravelCan
The TravelCan hybrid application can be used to find travel(flight/car-share) partners and to find people to share accommodation with. It was developed with the motivation of solving the problems faced by Internation students when they move to a new country for studies. This application can prove to be helful in the early stages of emmigration. Having a buddy always eases life! :)
